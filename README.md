# MuncheeModel
## Purpose
`MuncheeModel` is a Swift Package that is created to serve as the `Model` layer for the demo app [Munchee](https://github.com/LucasVanDongen/Munchee). Please read the [Munchee app's README](https://github.com/LucasVanDongen/Munchee#readme) to understand it's purpose.

Some of the things I am showcasing in this repo:
* How to design a good `Model` for your app
* How to protect this `Model`'s State in every occasion
* How I test such a `Model` layer
* How you can cleanly separate your app's `Model` layer in a separte repo, allowing you to hide most members except the ones explicitly called `public`
* Some of Swift 5.9's new features
